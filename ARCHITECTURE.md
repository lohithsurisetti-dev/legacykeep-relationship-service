# Relationship Service Architecture

## Overview
The Relationship Service is designed to handle the complex domain of user relationships in a flexible, scalable, and maintainable way. It follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and implements a microservices architecture pattern.

## Domain Model

### Core Concepts

#### Relationship
A connection between two users with a specific type and context. Relationships are:
- **Bidirectional**: Each relationship has a reverse relationship
- **Temporal**: Can have start and end dates
- **Contextual**: Can exist within specific contexts (family circles, groups)
- **Status-aware**: Can be active, ended, suspended, or pending

#### Relationship Type
Defines the nature of a relationship:
- **Predefined Types**: Standard relationships (Father, Son, Spouse, etc.)
- **Custom Types**: User-defined relationship types
- **Categories**: Family, Social, Professional, Custom
- **Bidirectional**: Whether the relationship works both ways

#### Context
The environment or group where a relationship exists:
- **Family Circles**: Family groups and circles
- **Social Groups**: Friend groups, communities
- **Professional Networks**: Work relationships, professional circles

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### Bounded Context
The Relationship Service represents the "Relationship Management" bounded context, which includes:
- Relationship definitions and types
- Relationship lifecycle management
- Relationship validation and rules
- Relationship queries and analytics

#### Domain Entities
- **RelationshipType**: Defines relationship types and their properties
- **UserRelationship**: Represents actual relationships between users
- **RelationshipStatus**: Enum for relationship states
- **RelationshipCategory**: Enum for relationship categories

#### Domain Services
- **RelationshipService**: Core business logic for relationship management
- **RelationshipValidationService**: Business rules and validation
- **RelationshipTypeService**: Management of relationship types

### 2. Microservices Architecture

#### Service Boundaries
The Relationship Service is bounded by:
- **Input**: User relationship requests and queries
- **Output**: Relationship data and events
- **Dependencies**: User Service (user validation), Family Circle Service (context)

#### Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Event publishing for data consistency
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka for dynamic service location

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

#### Domain Events
- **RelationshipCreatedEvent**: Published when a relationship is created
- **RelationshipUpdatedEvent**: Published when a relationship is updated
- **RelationshipDeletedEvent**: Published when a relationship is deleted
- **RelationshipStatusChangedEvent**: Published when relationship status changes

#### Event Flow
```
User Action → Relationship Service → Event Publisher → Other Services
```

## Data Model

### Entity Relationships

    RelationshipType ||--o{ UserRelationship : "defines"
    UserRelationship }o--|| User : "user1"
    UserRelationship }o--|| User : "user2"
    UserRelationship }o--o| FamilyCircle : "context"
    
    RelationshipType {
        Long id PK
        String name
        String category
        Boolean bidirectional
        Long reverseTypeId FK
        String metadata
        LocalDateTime createdAt
        LocalDateTime updatedAt
    }
    
    UserRelationship {
        Long id PK
        Long user1Id FK
        Long user2Id FK
        Long relationshipTypeId FK
        Long contextId FK
        LocalDate startDate
        LocalDate endDate
        RelationshipStatus status
        String metadata
        LocalDateTime createdAt
        LocalDateTime updatedAt
    }
```

### Database Design

#### Normalization Strategy
- **3NF Compliance**: Eliminates redundancy while maintaining performance
- **Denormalization**: Strategic denormalization for query performance
- **Indexing**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns

#### Performance Considerations
- **Composite Indexes**: For multi-column queries
- **Partial Indexes**: For filtered queries (active relationships)
- **JSONB**: For flexible metadata storage

## Service Layer Architecture

### 1. Controller Layer
- **REST Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Request Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Response Mapping**: DTO to Entity mapping
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses

### 2. Service Layer
- **Business Logic**: Core relationship management logic
- **Validation**: Business rules and constraints
- **Transaction Management**: ACID compliance
- **Event Publishing**: Domain event publishing

### 3. Repository Layer
- **Data Access**: JPA/Hibernate for database operations
- **Query Optimization**: Custom queries for performance
- **Caching**: Strategic caching for frequently accessed data

### 4. Security Layer
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS and injection prevention

## API Design

### RESTful API Principles
- **Resource-based URLs**: Clear resource identification
- **HTTP Methods**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Status Codes**: Meaningful HTTP status codes
- **Content Negotiation**: JSON response format

### API Versioning
- **URL Versioning**: `/v1/relationships`
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.legacykeep.v1+json`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility for at least 2 versions

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Relationship created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "user1Id": 100,
    "user2Id": 200,
    "relationshipType": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Father",
      "category": "FAMILY"
    },
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Shared secret with other services
- **Token Validation**: Automatic validation on all endpoints
- **Token Refresh**: Support for token refresh mechanism

### Authorization
